<h2>My Trip to Thailand </h2> <p id="date">Posted on 18 august 2024 </p>
<p id="l1">Last week, I had the amazing opportunity to visit Bangkok-Thailand. Here are some highlights:</p>
<div>
<h3>1.The Grand Palace</h3> 
<p id="grand">Every visitor to Bangkok should see the magnificent buildings within the Grand Palace compound to get a feeling of the grandeur architectural style. Since the founding of Bangkok as the Nations capital by King Rama I,
The grand palace has been the major architectural symbol of The Thai Royal family. In the present time, The Royal Family resides at Chitralada Palace while The Grand Palace is used for ceremonial purposes. Located at the heart of Bangkok, Thailand, the Grand Palace was a former residence for King Rama I to King Rama V of the Rattanakosin Kingdom. Today, the place is used for hosting royal ceremonies and welcoming the king's guests, State guests, and other foreign dignitaries.

<h3>2.Seri Thai Garden</h3>
<p>Seri Thai Garden, formerly known as BuengKum Water Park, is a public park which is located at MoobanSahakorn, Serithai Road, Bang Kum District, Bangkok. The garden covers an area of 57 rai. Originally, "BuengKum" or "Bueng Ta Thong" was an old, large public pond that became shallower due to man's doings. In 1985, restoration and development for the park started following His Majesty's initiative project to create a flood control reservoir for Bangkok. The pond can hold up to 1.5 million cubic metres and has floodgates which control water level and release water to BuengKum Canal and onward to SaenSaeb Canal.</p>
